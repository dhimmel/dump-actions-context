# GitHub actions contexts by event type

Contexts are combined into a single JSON file and named by the actions [event type](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#available-events).
The JSON files are also exported in [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) format for easy identification of the absolute path to a value.
